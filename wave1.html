    <h1>Wave 1</h1>
    <p>In Wave 1, the class conceptualized and finalized the idea of the project. As part of Arts & Design, our task for Research was to design a sustainable livelihood project for Haven for Children, a DSWD institution for children recovering from various forms of abuse. To do this, we first had to get information about our beneficiary. </p>
    <p>We did this through an immersion, where we went to the institution ourselves. There, we conducted a needs assessment with the people there. While one group interviewed the children, the other (which I was part of) interviewed the administrators. From the answers collected, we discovered that their need is a sustainable way to earn money. The core problem, lack of funding, affects all aspects of the children’s lives: examples including school materials and the quality of living facilities.</p>
    <p>Once we figured out the problem, the next step was devising the solution. Since we’re an Arts & Design class, our solution had to revolves around the arts in some way. Thankfully, from our immersion, we also discovered that the children have a natural inclination towards the arts. With this, we had to make sure that our solution was something that the children were capable of doing; aside from this, it also had to be something they could learn from.</p>
    <p>It took a while to design the perfect project for them. Our first idea was hand-crafted soap. Unfortunately, this was denied due to its unsuitability for Arts & Design and the dangers it could pose to the children. As a result, we had to start from scratch again. The product team then thought of “Lubela”, a brand of handwoven home decor products. This was both safe and easy to do for the children. Because of this, the idea was approved by our research advisors, making it our final project idea.</p>
    <p>In this project, I was part of the website group, which was responsible for creating the digital branding for the livelihood project. This was the proposed solution to the community’s poor reach, which was the root cause of their lack of funding. It was composed of the following: website, Facebook page, and manuals. We created these components based on the data we had from Haven for Children and the draft products of the product team.</p>
    <p>Despite the challenges the class faced in conceptualizing, it was all worth it to find the perfect idea for our beneficiary. </p>
