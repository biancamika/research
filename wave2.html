    <h1>Wave 2</h1>
    <p>In Wave 2, the class did the project implementation. This was last February 22. To do this, we went back to Haven for Children. We were divided into two groups; one group taught the children how to make the products while the other presented the project to the administrators. I was part of the latter.</p>
    <p>On behalf of the website team, I (along with Steve and Eliza) presented the proposal. We explained the gist of our project and showed mockups as a reference. They liked the designs presented to them. However, they were worried that the project could not be executed; this is because it had to be subject to government approval. Since the process for this would take forever, they suggested making the focus of the website solely on Lubela. They also suggested designing a brochure version, which they saw as more feasible.</p>
    <p>When I learned of their input, I was initially saddened. I thought that all the hard work of the website team would go to waste. Thankfully, I was told by my classmates and advisors that this wasn’t the case. Even if they liked it, it wasn’t in their power to approve it. This is why they suggested alternatives to us. I also had to consider their perspective. Despite how modern the world is nowadays, the institution still has an old and conservative mindset; this meant that using technology was quite new to them. This is why they were leaning towards brochures, which they had more experience in handling. Overall, this wave taught me to be more empathetic.</p>
