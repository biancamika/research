    <h1>Wave 4</h1>
    <p>In Wave 4, the class did a turnover of the capstone project to Haven for Children. This was done on March 20 in the 12M classroom. It was styled as a defense presentation, where people presented in the front while a panel (composed of both school and Haven for Children administrators/clients) listened.</p>
    <p>Despite not being the one to present for the website group, I was able to contribute by helping write the manual for the store logistics, which was needed since the Haven for Children administrators donâ€™t have much technical know-how.  It taught how to process online orders and deliver them to the customers. I based this on real-life practices of small online shops in social media. </p>
    <p>After our presentation, the panel gave their insights. Aside from a few questions, they were happy with the project. We then gave them our leftover materials, along with the first drafts of the manuals we made. To conclude, this entire project brought us outside of our comfort zone as privileged students, but for a good cause. I am thankful to Haven for Children for the whole learning experience; I am sure they feel the same.</p>
