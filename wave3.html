    <h1>Wave 3</h1>
    <p>In Wave 3, the class launched the capstone project. This was done last March 16 in Corte de las Palmas, Alabang Town Center. The purpose of this event was to promote the capstone project to the general public. </p>
    <p>Compared to the leaders and most of the launch team, my role in this wasn’t as crucial. However, I was still able to make an important contribution: buying the materials. Despite not being part of the product team, I volunteered to buy wood glue, twine, and bowls last minute after there were problems procuring materials (e.g. Purchasing office not responding). Without this initiative, I believe that the class wouldn’t even have products to showcase in the event.</p>
    <p>Aside from this, my other responsibility was to make at least two medium-sized bowls. In order to reach the quota imposed by the product team, everyone in the class had to make a certain number of products (depending on the size). Unfortunately, I was only able to start working on them Friday, the day before the event. This was due to the delay of materials and the deadlines for other school projects. As a result, I was only able to make one and a half (the half being done during the launch itself). The same seems to have happened to the rest of the class since we weren’t able to reach the quota.</p>
    <p>From what I saw in my shift, I believe the launch was successful: people bought products, we got possible contacts, etc. However, we still made mistakes (such as the failure of reaching quota mentioned above). With the help of Ms. Racquel, we were able to reflect on what went right or wrong, so that we could improve for the future. Despite the launch not being perfect, we left a good impact on Haven for Children; this is what matters the most.</p>
